                It&#39;s my privilege to have served the position of Chairperson in the ISTE MBCET Student&#39;s Chapter. I was
                able to build on my technical and soft skill set, after each event. We learned from each other and all our
                activities either encouraged or developed a skill among the students too. The whole hearted
                cooperation, enthusiasm and synergy exhibited by our office bearer team, ex- office bearer team and
                faculty chapter, helped us reach many milestones. Moreover, we are now, a family! Thank you ISTE
                MBCET for giving me, experiences, memories and people to treasure for a lifetime. May the society
                reflect it&#39;s legacy in the upcoming years too.

                Since the start of my fifth semester, ISTE gave me unlimited exposure, may it be gaining new
                contacts, or getting experience in working with people. Being part of a community of likeminded
                people, and being able to work with them, is probably the best experience one can get from MBCET.
                We faced many blocks at the start of the term, but eventually we came through it together, learning
                new skills that we never thought we would learn. The best part of this was the friends I gained
                through this community. The team gave me an experience I could never imagine, and that is, ISTE
                MBCET Student’s Chapter. Till date, and for long, it would be the best decision I made, that is, to join
                the ISTE executive committee.

                ISTE was a great experience for me personally and more over it was the first time for me to work with a
                community. ISTE actually helped me a lot to incultivate more skills both technical and soft skills and it
                was really a wonderful society to work with. I learnt so many things that adds to my career ISTE really
                gives you a space to grow and make others grow . During lockdown period for me it was not a vacation
                or a free time thanks to ISTE for keeping me engaged by conducting different events especially Memoir
                and Best Engineer and these events were the top ones too. I think not only me but some of you also
                were busy participating in ISTE events . This society really gives you an opportunity to interact with real
                world and gains you many contacts which may useful to your career too. So I believe, once you are in to
                ISTE you won&#39;t lose anything I damn confident that you will gain many.

                For me, ISTE MBCET students chapter team was a great opportunity for really getting to know about the
                typical leadership skills. It lives its mission of enhancing education through creative and effective uses of
                technology. At the core of the mission and the workplace is collaboration. Admist the other societies,
                students can work more and communicate or share each other their ideas in what they want to. It was a
                nice experience working with Meenakshy and team. After coming to ISTE I studied more things,
                especially about writing reports and all.

                It was a nice experience for me to work as a technical coordinator for the ISTE. I got an opportunity to
                work with my seniors and learn from them. We conducted more than 100 events as we planned and I
                made many contacts working as an execom member. I got skilled in some areas like poster designing ,
                conducting events as well as leading a team. Guidance of our faculties helped us in making the event
                fruitful. I congratulate the new execom members for joining the execom. We hope that the new execom
                will be able to conduct quality events and do more events than the previous execom.

                I would like to start by quoting this, “After climbing the mountain, you can finally enjoy the
                view.”<br />
                ISTE was the first technical society where I got the opportunity to become a part of the execom.
                Just like all the other beginners even I was tensed. New team, new people, I had no idea how
                this was gonna go. Eventually after several events and meetings we became friends. But now,
                after this whole year I could definitely say we are a family. This was one of the best experience
                baselios gave me. No words could appreciate the team work and effort my colleagues put into
                this. And definitely out hardwork paid off. I would also like to thank the faculties and the Ex-
                Office bearers for their endless support. Thank you and all the best to our next execom.

                skills. It also inculcated many qualities in me which is definitely going to help in the long run. Teamwork,
                commitment, and working towards a goal were few of the attributes that it has given me. We had a
                wonderful team, the ones who helped and guided one another. It helped me develop a stronger bond
                among students from other branches and even my juniors. I will always cherish this experience because
                I didn’t expect a lot when I joined this team. I feel college life is beyond just our academics, it is these
                experiences that shape you for your future. I’m very happy that I got this opportunity and I could make

                The ISTE team was a great opportunity for really getting to know about the typical skills one should
                have!! A really creative, collaborative, consistent, concerned, unbeaten community. The group of
                apprentices , who upheld the society, was the best part of it I should say that na.haha..This is one
                among the cynosure of Baselian life. ISTE indeed kindled our,( mine esp.) designing skills
                unmistakably, moreover our communicative skills and our technical skills . So an entry to ISTE
                STUDENTS CHAPTER , is a piece of gold to the blacksmith..
                ISTE this time went through a dual phase..as all of us know. Corona the gunman , so our travelling
                with the &quot;affair&quot; was quite thrilling and it geared up as well. The focal point of the society us it&#39;s
                reach to all branches,( CE,ME,EEE,EC,CS). Admist the other societies, students can work more in
                what they want to. Doesn&#39;t that sounds good comrades??
                So ,why aren&#39;t we yet into ISTE ?Grab your chance .Its souly yours.
                Have fun, have brains filled with ideas, have a bunch of memories, have YOU.. TAKE BACK A NEW
                VERSION OF YOUR SALAD DAYS.

                I feel it was a great opportunity to be a part of ISTE MBCET, else I would have sat in one corner of the
                class and limit my abilities within myself. The takeoff phase was a bit difficult as I didn’t know my team
                members ,I didn’t know how to contribute to the different plans the team makes, but eventually as time
                passed by the strangers became closer to my heart. During the flight towards conducting various events
                and activities I was able to discover my hidden abilities and utilize it for the society moreover the
                different phases made me independent and time and again teamwork proved to be more effective and
                consistent even during the times of pandemic. Trust me at the end of the day you would be happy to
                realize that from zero you have gained a lot in terms of skills, networking and potential abilities . As I
                approach towards the landing phase, it seems bit more difficult to leave the team and the memories
                that I cherished.

                made me a lot more confident in organising an event. Now, that I'm
                bidding adieu to ISTE, I can very honestly say that there were events
                that I planned properly well beforehand and there were the ones which
                happened in the last minute but nevertheless, I enjoyed organising each
                and every one of them and all the credit goes to our team and notably
                our very dear Meenakshi Chechi, who assigned us all with an event partner
                which made all our work seem more manageable.
                <br /> All the best to the newly selected Execom, I hope you guys will set a higher bar.
